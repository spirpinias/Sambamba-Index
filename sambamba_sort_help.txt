    LDC 1.28.1 / DMD v2.098.1 / LLVM12.0.0 / bootstrap LDC - the LLVM D compiler (1.28.1)

Usage: sambamba-sort [options] <input.bam>

Options: -m, --memory-limit=LIMIT
               approximate total memory limit for all threads (by default 2GB)
         --tmpdir=TMPDIR
               directory for storing intermediate files; default is system directory for temporary files
         -o, --out=OUTPUTFILE
               output file name; if not provided, the result is written to a file with .sorted.bam extension
         -n, --sort-by-name
               sort by read name instead of coordinate (lexicographical order)
         --sort-picard
               sort by query name like in picard
         -N, --natural-sort
               sort by read name instead of coordinate (so-called 'natural' sort as in samtools)
         -M, --match-mates
               pull mates of the same alignment together when sorting by read name
         -l, --compression-level=COMPRESSION_LEVEL
               level of compression for sorted BAM, from 0 to 9
         -u, --uncompressed-chunks
               write sorted chunks as uncompressed BAM (default is writing with compression level 1), that might be faster in some cases but uses more disk space
         -p, --show-progress
               show progressbar in STDERR
         -t, --nthreads=NTHREADS
               use specified number of threads
         -F, --filter=FILTER
               keep only reads that satisfy FILTER
